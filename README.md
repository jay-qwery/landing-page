# landing-page

This project was created as part of [The Odin Project's web development foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

As of 17/05/2022, I have successfully replicated the appearance and layout of [the provided image](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png). I would like to return to this afterwards and polish it some more.

### Notes for myself

As part of making the page responsive, I would like to change all px units to rem.
